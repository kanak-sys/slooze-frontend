🛒 Slooze Frontend Challenge – Role-Based Inventory System

This project is a frontend-only implementation of the Slooze Front-End Challenge.
It demonstrates authentication, role-based access control, protected routes, UI enhancements, and theme management, using assumed/mock data as permitted by the problem statement.

🚀 Tech Stack

React + Vite

React Router DOM

Context API (Authentication & Theme)

CSS (No UI library)

LocalStorage (Session & Theme persistence)

🔐 Authentication & Role-Based Access
Mocked Users (Assumed Data)
Role	Email	Password
Manager	manager@slooze.com
	1234
Store Keeper	store@slooze.com
	1234

⚠️ Backend APIs are mocked as allowed by the challenge instructions.
Authentication is simulated using Context API and localStorage.
